# HalloweenTrivia
## Intro
<P>
  This is a trivia game based on the horror movie Halloween.  It is a rough copy I am still working on.<br>
  I had this in another repo named differently but merged everything. It is written in JAVA and uses a comma seperated file<br> 
  (Excel) to store the question and answer data. It was initally a console project that now has GUIs and background music. <br>
  I plan on smoothing out more things and fine tuning it along the way.
